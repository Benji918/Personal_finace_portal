#  Personal Finance

This is a personal finance application built using the Django web framework. It allows users to track their expenses, create budgets, and see their spending habits over time.

## Proposed Features

- Add and categorize expenses
- Create and track budgets
- View spending trends and statistics
- Set financial goals and track progress towards them
- Secure login and data encryption

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Python (3.8 or later)
- Django (2.2 or later)

To check if you have Python installed, run the following command in your terminal:

`python --version`


To check if you have Django installed, run the following command in your terminal:

`python -m django --version`


If you don't have either of these programs installed, you can install them by following the instructions at the following links:

- [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Install Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/install/)

## Running the project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Benji918/Personal_finace_portal.git


2. Navigate to the root directory of the project:

`cd django-project`


3. Run the development server:

`python manage.py runserver`


This will start the development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

If you want to specify a different port, you can do so by using the `--port` flag, like this:

`python manage.py runserver --port 8080`


This will start the development server at http://127.0.0.1:8080/.

Keep in mind that the development server is for development purposes only, and is not intended for use in production. For more information on how to deploy a Django project, see the Django documentation.

## Using the application

Once the development server is running, you can access the application at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. Use the links and form inputs on the page to interact with the application.

## Shutting down the development server

To shut down the development server, open the terminal window in which it is running, and press `CTRL+C`. This will stop the server, and you will be returned to the command prompt.
